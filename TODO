- Move customizable items (conf/*, library.rb, profiles.rb) into a single
  subdirectory and provide a mechanism (probably based on an environment
  variable) for telling the core driver which set of customizations to use. This
  will help with peaceful co-existence between different implementations. For
  example, the versioned 'conf' directory will conflict with a user's
  implementation when updating from the repository.

- Factor methods (e.g. die, ext, job_activate, job_deactivate, logd, logd_flush,
  logi, etc.) likely to be needed by library implementors out into a module and
  document them.

- Better documentation in general!

- Allow group names in suite configs to optionally associate with modules in
  profiles.rb, to allow customized behavior in Comparison objects. Initially,
  it may be useful to provide alternatives to bit-for-bit comparisons between
  output files. Common#comp could call e.g. lib_comparator to compare two files,
  and the comparison mechanism could be controlled via profiles.rb modules.

- Provide a mechanism (with exactly-once semantics) for runs to associate with
  specific data sets.
