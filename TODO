- Add a HISTORY file and versioned git tags. Add 'ddts version' command.

- Provide a mechanism (with exactly-once semantics) for runs to associate with
  specific data sets.

- Generalize alternate comparator mechanism and get rid of profiles.rb? Have
  defaults.rb overridden by library.rb overridden by configs.

- Add info on env vars to README.
