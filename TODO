- Allow group names in suite configs to optionally associate with modules in
  profiles.rb, to allow customized behavior in Comparison objects. Initially,
  it may be useful to provide alternatives to bit-for-bit comparisons between
  output files. Common#comp could call e.g. lib_comparator to compare two files,
  and the comparison mechanism could be controlled via profiles.rb modules.

- Place test-suite output in a subdirectory of 'conf' (or the directory named
  by environment variable DDTSCONF), to avoid collisions between multiple
  implementations. Allow this location to be overriden via another environment
  variable, maybe DDTSOUT.

- Switch to explicit gen-baseline= / use-baseline= command-line parameters, to
  avoid collisions between multiple implementations.

- Add a HISTORY file and versioned git tags. Add 'ddts version' command.

- Tests for ts.rb (can it test itself?)

- Provide a mechanism (with exactly-once semantics) for runs to associate with
  specific data sets.

- Better documentation in general.
