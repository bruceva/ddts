- Factor methods (e.g. die, ext, job_activate, job_deactivate, logd, logd_flush,
  logi, etc.) likely to be needed by library implementors out into a module and
  document them.

- Better documentation in general.

- Allow group names in suite configs to optionally associate with modules in
  profiles.rb, to allow customized behavior in Comparison objects. Initially,
  it may be useful to provide alternatives to bit-for-bit comparisons between
  output files. Common#comp could call e.g. lib_comparator to compare two files,
  and the comparison mechanism could be controlled via profiles.rb modules.

- Provide a mechanism (with exactly-once semantics) for runs to associate with
  specific data sets.
