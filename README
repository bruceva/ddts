DDTS

Quick Start

  ddts [suite]               : run standard or named suite
  ddts baseline [suite]      : run standard or named suite & store a baseline
  ddts clean                 : remove most objects created by the test suite
  ddts cleaner               : ddts clean + removes 'baseline' & data archive
  ddts help                  : shows this usage information
  ddts run <name>            : perform the single named run
  ddts show run|suite <name> : show configuration of the named run or suite

Baseline Creation / Comparison

  To create a baseline, run 'ddts baseline [suite]'. If [suite] is unspecified,
  the 'standard' suite will be used. A directory named 'baseline' (which must
  not already exist) will be created in the current directory, and the output of
  the test-suite runs stored there.

  The test suite will automatically compare its runs' output to the contents of
  the 'baseline' directory if one exists. You may copy or link a previously
  generated baseline directory here, or make a new one with the 'baseline'
  command (see above).

A useful workflow might consist of these steps:

  1. Check out a fresh working copy.
  2. Run 'ddts baseline [suite]' to generate a baseline.
  3. Make changes to the working copy as needed.
  4. Run 'ddts [suite]' to verify your changes against the baseline.

Logging

  Each 'ddts' invocation that does not fail immediately generates a verbose
  logfile named 'log.timestamp', where timestamp is the seconds-since-epoch
  test-suite start time.
