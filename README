FIM Test Suite

Quick Start

  ts [suite]             : do the standard or named suite
  ts baseline [suite]    : do the standard or named suite & store a baseline
  ts clean               : remove most objects created by the test suite
  ts cleaner             : ts clean + removes 'baseline' & data archive
  ts show run|suite name : show configuration of the named run or suite

  Any other argument to 'ts' is interpreted as a suite name.

Baseline Creation / Comparison

  To create a baseline, run 'ts baseline <suite>'. If <suite> is unspecified,
  the standard suite will be used. A directory named 'baseline' (which must not
  already exist) will be created in the current directory, and the output of the
  test-suite jobs stored there, in an appropriate directory hierarchy.

  The test suite will automatically compare its runs' output to the contents of
  the 'baseline' directory if it exists. You may copy or link a previously-
  generated baseline directory here, or make a new one with the 'baseline'
  command (see above).

A useful workflow might consist of these steps:

  1. Check out a fresh FIM working copy from Subversion.
  2. Run 'ts baseline <suite>' to generate a clean baseline.
  3. Make changes to the working copy as needed.
  4. Run 'ts' to verify your changes against the baseline.

Logging

  Each 'ts' invocation that does not fail immediately generates a verbose
  logfile named 'log.timestamp', where timestamp is the seconds-since-epoch
  test-suite start time.
