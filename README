DDTS Test Suite

Quick Start

  ddts <suite>                        : run the named suite
  ddts baseline <suite>               : run the named suite & store a baseline
  ddts clean                          : remove most test-suite created items
  ddts cleaner                        : clean + remove baseline & data archive
  ddts help                           : shows this usage information
  ddts run <run>                      : perform the single specified run
  ddts show run <run> | suite <suite> : show the named run or suite config

Baseline Creation / Comparison

  Run 'ddts baseline <suite>' to create a baseline. Valid <suite> values are
  the names of the files in the conf/suites directory. A directory named
  'baseline' will be created in the current directory, if it does not already
  exist, and one subdirectory will be created under it for each unique
  'baseline' value specified in the configs of the suite's various runs. These
  subdirectories must not already exist.

  The test suite will automatically compare its runs' output to the contents of
  the 'baseline' directory if one exists. You may copy or link a previously
  generated baseline directory here.

A useful workflow might consist of these steps:

  1. Check out a fresh working copy.
  2. Run 'ddts baseline <suite>' to generate a baseline.
  3. Make changes to the working copy as needed.
  4. Run 'ddts <suite>' to verify your changes against the baseline.

Logging

  Each 'ddts' invocation that does not fail immediately generates a verbose
  logfile named 'log.timestamp', where timestamp is the seconds-since-epoch
  test-suite start time.
